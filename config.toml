Racklet is a fully-integrated, miniature server rack. Racklet aims to inspire their users to explore how modern,
advanced server architectures work in practice, in a tangible and educational way. With the new-found knowledge
and inspiration, the user may apply their modernization skills on traditional server infrastructure, which
improves the status quo and pushes the industry forward. <br/><br/> The following are the core values of the project:

We aspire to improve the status quo of "secure-by-default" solutions and concepts available, by using
e.g. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [LinuxBoot](https://www.linuxboot.org/) and [TUF](https://theupdateframework.io/).
We challenge some security norms in the industry and move past e.g. insecure protocols like [TFTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol).
The design methodologies "Defense in Depth" and "Least Privilege" will be applied.

text   = """
Declarative management using e.g. [YAML](https://yaml.org) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is prominent in the cloud native space, but not
equally in the embedded and firmware space. We believe declarative APIs are very useful and powerful,
as they allow for observe-diff-act reconciliation loops. Consistent Kubernetes-style APIs will be used
across the stack.

Racklet is 100% open source software and hardware. Anyone can contribute, improve,

text   = """
The modularity of the system should allow that individual pieces of the system (e.g. compute,
storage, network switches, power supplies) should be upgradable without having to disrupt the
rest of the rack, or disregard existing, functioning parts. This will minimize E-waste produced over time.

modules implementing the same interfaces, or extensibility where the user demands custom features.
